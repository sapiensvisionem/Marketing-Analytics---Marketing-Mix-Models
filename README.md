# Marketing-Analytics-on-Marketing Mix Models

This was a final project for Marketing Analytics class taught by Professor Anil Chaturvedi in 2019 March. 

Analysis was conducted on Nielsen's retail data across the stores in the United States in 2016 and 2017. 

1. I use Bayesian Hierarchical model to conduct marketin mix on each unique customer.

2. I use K-Mode and Latent Class Analysis models to compute customer segments.
